# Frontend Mentor - Room homepage solution

This is a solution to the [Room homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/room-homepage-BtdBY_ENq). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview
Web Development challenge to practice my front end skills.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their keyboard

## My process
To help with site performance on mobile devices I followed the mobile first methodology and configured the media queries to cater to mobile platofrms with a view width of 375px or less. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a slideshow with Vanilla JS, css, and HTML. Before I would just use bootstrap for most of my stylings. It was good to practice and learn how CSS frameworks configure their components. Having to create the styles on my own helped me get a better understanding of the proporties used in common web development.
